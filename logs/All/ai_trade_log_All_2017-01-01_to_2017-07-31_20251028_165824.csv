2017-01-30,"I selected ETFs with strong bullish momentum indicators, focusing on those with RSI above 70 indicating overbought conditions that may persist in a trending market, and positive MACD histograms where available. However, all MACD values are zero, limiting momentum analysis, so I prioritized high RSI and price above EMAs for trend strength. Choices like QQQ.O and SPYG.P show extremely high RSI (>90), suggesting strong upward momentum, while others like XLE.P with lower RSI (35.192) were excluded due to potential weakness.","['QQQ.O', 'SPYG.P', 'VONG.O', 'VUG.P', 'XLY.P']","['QQQ.O', 'SPYG.P', 'VONG.O', 'VUG.P', 'XLY.P']","{'QQQ.O': 0.2, 'SPYG.P': 0.2, 'VONG.O': 0.2, 'VUG.P': 0.2, 'XLY.P': 0.2}"
